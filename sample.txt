Thank you for purchasing the MEAP edition of Build a Large Language
Model (From Scratch).
In this book, I invite you to embark on an educational journey with me to
learn how to build Large Language Models (LLMs) from the ground up.
Together, we'll delve deep into the LLM training pipeline, starting from data
loading and culminating in finetuning LLMs on custom datasets.
For many years, I've been deeply immersed in the world of deep learning,
coding LLMs, and have found great joy in explaining complex concepts
thoroughly. This book has been a long-standing idea in my mind, and I'm
thrilled to finally have the opportunity to write it and share it with you. Those
of you familiar with my work, especially from my blog, have likely seen
glimpses of my approach to coding from scratch. This method has resonated
well with many readers, and I hope it will be equally effective for you.
I've designed the book to emphasize hands-on learning, primarily using
PyTorch and without relying on pre-existing libraries. With this approach,
coupled with numerous figures and illustrations, I aim to provide you with a
thorough understanding of how LLMs work, their limitations, and
customization methods. Moreover, we'll explore commonly used workflows
and paradigms in pretraining and fine-tuning LLMs, offering insights into
their development and customization.
The book is structured with detailed step-by-step introductions, ensuring no
critical detail is overlooked. To gain the most from this book, you should
have a background in Python programming. Prior experience in deep learning
and a foundational understanding of PyTorch, or familiarity with other deep
learning frameworks like TensorFlow, will be beneficial.
I warmly invite you to engage in the liveBook discussion forum for any
questions, suggestions, or feedback you might have. Your contributions are
immensely valuable and appreciated in enhancing this learning journey.
